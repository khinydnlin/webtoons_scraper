# Webtoons Scraper

## Project Objective

Considering the sparse analysis available around the world of webtoons, I was driven to create a dataset for those interested in exploring these trends. In this project, I developed a webscraper using Scrapy to collect data from over 1,000 webtoons across various genres on the 'Webtoon' website. The scraper captures key information such as genres, ratings, likes, and status/release days. Initially designed for single-time use, it can also be manually rerun at regular intervals to capture new entries and updates to existing webtoons. This is essential for monitoring evolving trends and changes in webtoon popularity.
