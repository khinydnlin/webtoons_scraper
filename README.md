# Webtoons Scraper

In this project, I developed a webscraper using Scrapy to systematically collect data from over 1,000 webtoons across various genres from the 'Webtoon' website. The scraper gathers essential information such as genres, ratings, likes, and status/release days. It wad designed for single-time execution- however, it can be manually rerun at regular intervals to capture new entries and updates to existing webtoons, which is crucial for tracking evolving trends and changes in webtoon popularity. This repeated use allows for the aggregation of a rich dataset over time.
